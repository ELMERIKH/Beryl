Greetings

Beryl deliver your PE (exe) straight to the victim

victim only has to run the generated file wich execute as UA by default

if user doesn t execute as admin programme won't run

ps: you need a valid link to install and your PE on the victim machine
    also if your PE is does not use evasion techniques then its useless ;)

usage: beryl.py [-h] 

-d DIRECTORY_PATH 
-url URL 
-n OUTPUT_NAME 
[-g {Snake,FlapyBird,Turtle,RaceCar}]
